This the Genie API scripts to handle calls inside the AWS lambda function.
Currently this is a premature release with restricted access to the imputs and capabilities of the Genie family lol

Current accessible settings:
... None, is not made to work outside of ruben's local computer where it has been manually set up to run ... 
... This is only a backup repo for quick version reference and rollbacks (basically main brach == shitshow, but my shitshow)...
